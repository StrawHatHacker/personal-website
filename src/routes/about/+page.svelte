        Hello, nice to meet you! I'm Panos, I'm a web developer and designer,
        currently living in Crete Greece. I'm {age ?? 25} years old, I have a 2 year
        old cat named Hercules and a 7 year old white lion bunny named Fiona.

        I started learning Python when I was 16 years old while persuing a
        carreer in tech. In university I picked up eth1cal h4cking, trying to
        solve puzzles of Hack The Box. But what got me really into code, was the
        very first version of my chatbot Shiro. <br /> <br />
        After Shiro, I started learning HTML and CSS and kept adding new technologies
        to my stack. A few freelance projects I managed to get, pushed me to learn
        how the back-end works, databases, authorization techniques and how to deploy
        my services efficiently. <br /> <br />
        Right now, I'm a confident developer that will not back away from a challenge!

      <p>
        My main tech stack usually consists of SvelteKit & tailwind for the
        front-end, and fastify.js with MongoDB for the back-end. <br /><br />
        For static pages I use
        <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">render.com</a>, and for
        cloud servers I use <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">hetzner</a>.
        <br /><br />
        Alternatives to the technologies mentioned above are React for SPAs, Go with
        GIN for the backend or Sveltekits's endpoints, and sqlite instead of MongoDB
        for small datasets.

        Currently I'm learning Next.js to supercharge my React development,
        <br />
        Flutter, to gain the üéâfullstack statusüéâ, and I'm trying to get better at
        designing on Figma for more stunning results üòä
